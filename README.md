A Javascript + React based game for teaching spelling and keyboard skills to children.

Extensive use of hooks throughout for state management (useReducer + useContext) and data loading + stopwatch function (useEffect). Implements a high score system in conjunction with a back-end API (with MySQL for data storage).

Styled with vanilla CSS (no pre-processor), with use of loaded web fonts and keyframe animation.

The software is written in VS Code, bootstrapped and compiled using Vite. Hosted via a standard VPS (HostPresto).
